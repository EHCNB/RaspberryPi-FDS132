# RaspberryPi-FDS132
Code to connect a FDS132 to a RaspberryPi. As a base, the code from Jan Panteltje (http://panteltje.com/panteltje/raspberry_pi_FDS132_matrix_display_driver/index.html) was used. 

The original code worked only on a Raspberry Pi 1. This code uses the code
from http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/examples.html#Misc_code in order to detect
the version of the Raspberry Pi.  

This has been tested on the Rapsberry Pi 1, 2 and 3.
