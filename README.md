# RaspberryPi-FDS132
Code to connect a FDS132 to a RaspberryPi.

Based on the code of Jan Panteltje http://panteltje.com/panteltje/raspberry_pi_FDS132_matrix_display_driver/index.html. 

The original code worked only on a Raspberry Pi 1. The code in this repository expands the original code with 
Raspberry Pi detection and ought to work on both PI's.
